## Bug 1: Case-Sensitive Image Path References (Broken Links)

### **Issue Description**
The HTML contained image references with incorrect case sensitivity, causing broken image links on case-sensitive file systems (like Linux production servers).

### **Specific Problems Found**
- `assets/fouad.jpg` referenced but actual file is `assets/Fouad.jpg` (capital F)
- `assets/Conf2.jpg` referenced but actual file is `assets/conf2.jpg` (lowercase c)  
- `assets/Conf3.jpg` referenced but actual file is `assets/conf3.jpg` (lowercase c)
- `assets/Conf4.jpg` referenced but actual file is `assets/conf4.jpg` (lowercase c)
- Missing `ref_logo4.png` from partners section despite existing in assets

### **Impact**
- **Severity**: High
- **User Impact**: Images fail to load on production servers, causing poor user experience
- **Business Impact**: Professional credibility damaged by broken team photos and conference images

### **Files Modified**
- `index.html` (lines 69, 101, 440-442, 451-453, and partners section)

### **Fix Applied**
1. Corrected all case-sensitive image paths to match actual filenames
2. Added missing `ref_logo4.png` to partners section
3. Updated both French and English language sections consistently

## Bug 2: Language Switching Accessibility and Performance Issues

### **Issue Description**
The language switching functionality had multiple accessibility violations and performance problems:
1. Used inline `style="display:none"` which screen readers couldn't interpret properly
2. Missing `lang` attributes on HTML elements for proper language identification
3. Inline styles scattered throughout HTML making maintenance difficult
4. No ARIA attributes for assistive technologies

### **Impact**
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **User Impact**: Screen readers couldn't properly announce language changes
- **SEO Impact**: Search engines couldn't properly index multilingual content
- **Maintenance Impact**: Inline styles made code harder to maintain

### **Files Modified**
- `index.html` (navigation, hero section, partners section, footer, and JavaScript)
- `style.css` (added language switching CSS rules)

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Removed all inline styles** and replaced with CSS class-based approach
2. **Added proper `lang` attributes** (`lang="fr"` and `lang="en"`) to all language-specific elements
3. **Improved JavaScript functionality**:
   - Uses body class approach instead of inline styles
   - Updates `document.documentElement.lang` for proper document language
   - Added ARIA attributes (`aria-pressed`, `role="button"`) for accessibility
4. **Added CSS rules** for `.lang-en` body class to control language visibility

## Bug 3: Performance Issue with Large Images and Missing Optimization

### **Issue Description**
The website loaded many large images simultaneously without optimization, causing slow page loading and poor performance, especially on mobile devices and slower connections.

### **Specific Problems**
- No lazy loading on images below the fold
- All images loading simultaneously on page load
- No smooth loading transitions
- Missing responsive image optimization
- Large conference and product images causing bandwidth waste

### **Impact**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **User Impact**: Slow page loading times, especially on mobile devices
- **Performance Impact**: High bandwidth usage, poor Core Web Vitals scores
- **Business Impact**: Higher bounce rates due to slow loading

### **Files Modified**
- `index.html` (added `loading="lazy"` to all appropriate images)
- `style.css` (added image optimization CSS)

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Added `loading="lazy"` attribute** to all images in:
   - Partners logos section
   - Product images (both French and English sections)
   - Keynote/conference images (both languages)
2. **Implemented CSS-based loading optimization**:
   - Added smooth fade-in transitions for lazy-loaded images
   - Responsive image sizing with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`
   - Loading state management with opacity transitions
3. **Added JavaScript enhancement**:
   - Automatic detection of loaded images
   - Smooth fade-in effect when images complete loading
   - Handles both already-loaded and dynamically-loaded images

## Testing and Validation

### **Before Fixes**
- Broken images on Linux servers
- Poor accessibility scores
- Slow initial page load (all images loaded immediately)
- Screen readers couldn't identify language changes

### **After Fixes**
- ✅ All images load correctly on case-sensitive systems
- ✅ Proper language identification for screen readers  
- ✅ Improved page load performance with lazy loading
- ✅ Better accessibility with ARIA attributes
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code structure

## Summary

These fixes address critical issues affecting:
1. **Functionality**: Broken image links that would fail in production
2. **Accessibility**: Language switching barriers for users with disabilities  
3. **Performance**: Slow loading times affecting user experience

The improvements ensure the website is more robust, accessible, and performant across all devices and environments.
